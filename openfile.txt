   Select a file containing astrometric observations.  These can be in the
MPC's 80-column format,  or PSV ADES,  or XML ADES.  See

https://projectpluto.com/astromet.htm

   for details on what formats this program will accept.

   If the file has data on one object,  that data will immediately be read
and an orbit calculated.  If it has data for two or more objects,  you'll
be able to select the one in which you're interested.

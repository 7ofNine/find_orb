/* Code to convert Spacewatch pointing log into the form expected
by 'cssfield.c'.   Note comments at bottom of this file on the format
of that log. Also see 'cssfield.c' for comments on the format of the
output from this program.  Compile with

gcc -Wall -O3 -o sw_xvt sw_xvt.c

   We read lines from the SW log.  If it starts with

    UT DATE: mmm dd, yyyy

   we reset the date (converted to ISO form).  If it's got an RA
and a dec in it,  we look after those for times of observation,  of
which there can be up to three.  For each of those times of observation,
we output a line with the RA and dec in decimal degrees,  the ISO
formatted observation time,  the MPC code 691,  and 'na' (the filename
is Not Applicable here.)

   That puts everything in the 'standard' CSV format inhaled by
'cssfield',  dumping to stdout.

   It assumes the log file is

Spacewatch_mosaic.log.2003Mar23-2016Dec24.txt

   You can specify a different name on the command line.       */

/*   (The following is an edited snip from an e-mail I sent to Bob
McMillan,  in which I attempted to puzzle out the format of the
Spacewatch pointing log.)

   An example of text from the Spacewatch pointing log :

    UT DATE: Mar 23, 2003   OBSERVER(s): J.A.Larsen
   Reg.Center    Dirs                RA          Dec     sec       Time1 FWHM      Time2 FWHM      Time3 FWHM
   ==========================================================================================================
   06.01         1,12,22       11:43:12    +05:11:48     120    06:11:20 1.7"   07:14:51 1.6"   07:52:47 1.8"

   This is telling me that on 2003 Mar 23,  three images were taken centered
at RA=11:43:12,  dec=+05:11:48 (in epoch of date),  at 06:11:20, 07:14:51,
and 07:52:47 UTC. The exposures were all 120 seconds long,  with the seeing
given as FWHM.  J. A. Larsen was the observer.

   In the MPC sky coverage files,  it looks as if this is translated into
a single rectangle,  about 1.85 degrees wide and 1.73 degrees high.  This
is also the approach used in 'sw_xvt.c':  the above line is translated
into three rectangles for the same piece of the sky,  imaged at three
different times,  plus a comment line,  resulting in :

#  Mar 23, 2003   OBSERVER(s): J.A.Larsen
175.800,5.197,2003-03-23T06:12:20.000,691,na
175.800,5.197,2003-03-23T07:15:51.000,691,na
175.800,5.197,2003-03-23T07:53:47.000,691,na

   So from the standpoint of 'sw_xvt.c',  the above is all you need to know.
In theory,  though,  the rectangles output by the program are really just a
first step.  Each of those 1.85 by 1.73 rectangles should be broken up into
eight image files,  corresponding to two images each from four CCDs.

http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2007IAUS..236..329M

   shows a layout of four 4608x2048 CCDs,  three horizontal and one vertical,
covering 2.9 square degrees.

   Each of the four CCDs shown below is 4608x2048 pixels,  13.5 microns
square.  A sketch made by Marcus L. Perry,  then Chief Engineer,  shows that
each chip has an edge on the long sides of about 0.260 +/- 0.050 mm,  and
on the short sides of 0.120 +/- 0.050 mm.  Add that in,  and the "total,
real" small axis of each CCD is 2048 * 0.0135 + 2 * 0.260 = 28.168 mm;  the
real large axis is 4608 * 0.0135 + 2 * 0.120 = 62.448 mm.

   Between the three parallel CCDs,  there's a gap of 0.508 +/- 0.025 mm.
So the total distance from A to C is (3*28.168) + (2*0.508) = 85.520 mm.

   Between those three CCDs and the one shown vertically below,  there
is also a 0.508 +/- 0.025 mm gap.  So the horizontal distance from A to
B (or C to D) is width plus height plus one gap,  or 91.124 mm.

   +---------------+        B

   |               |       |     (figure 1 of the above paper,  in ASCII...

   +---------------+        D
  C

   X,  the center point,  is equidistant from A, B, C,  and D.
Call the distance EX = x;  then x^2 + EA^2 = (EF - x)^2 + FB^2,
or EA^2 = EF^2 - 2EFx + FB^2,  or x = (FB^2 + EF^2 - EA^2) / 2EF,
where EA = 85.520 / 2 = 42.76 mm, FB = 62.448 / 2 = 31.224 mm,
and EF = 91.124 mm.  Hence,  x = 40.879 mm.

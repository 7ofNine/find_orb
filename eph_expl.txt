   RA/decs are astrometric J2000 coordinates (corrected for light
time lag,  but in the inertial J2000 frame,  i.e.,  not rotated
for precession or nutation,  and differential light deflection is
not included.)   Display can be turned on/off in the 'advanced
options' for ephemerides.  When turning them on,  you can select
from various format choices (base-60,  decimal, different
precisions,  etc.)
;
; The following line means "show if either quantity 22 (distance
; to object) or 23 (distance to sun) is turned on."  Which,  for
; historical reasons,  corresponds to those bits _not_ being set.

   Distances are in kilometers for distances under one million km
(about 0.00668 AU),  and in AUs for larger distances.
#  3

   Alt/az values are in degrees.  North=0, East=90.
#  4,19

   Radial and 'space' velocities are in km/s.  Negative radial
velocities mean the object is approaching the observer.
#  5

   Apparent motions are given in arcminutes/hour,  or (equivalently)
arcseconds/minute.
# 11

   The phase angle bisector gives the ecliptic lat/lon of the point
midway between the vector from observer to target and the vector
from sun to target.  This can be useful in analyzing light curves.

   The "SM" (Sun-Moon) flags consist of one or two letters,  extended
from a scheme used on JPL's Horizons system.  Letters used are :

      * Daytime (sun above horizon)
      C Civil twilight (sun below horizon,  but by less than 6 degrees)
      N Nautical twilight (-12 < sun's altitude < -6 degrees)
      A Astronomical twilight (-18 < sun's altitude < -12 degrees)
      m Moon is in the sky,  less than 50% illuminated
      M Moon is in the sky,  more than 50% illuminated
      l Object transiting in front of moon
      L Object occulted by moon
      a Below altitude/horizon limits set for the observing site
      d Outside declination limits for your site/mount
      e Outside elongation limits for your site/mount
      h Outside hour angle limits for your site/mount
      g Some galactic confusion
      G Lots of galactic confusion
      B Object is below the horizon

   Sky brightness is in magnitudes per square arcsecond,  computed
using the Krisciunas & Schaefer model,

http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1990PASP..102..212S
http://articles.adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1991PASP..103.1033K

   This provides a good approximation to background brightness due
to moonlight,  twilight,  and airglow.

   The 'galactic confusion' is computed from star counts per unit
area from Gaia-DR2.  Values range from zero (effectively no
confusion) to 100 (densest parts of the Milky Way,  Magellanic
Clouds,  or globular clusters).

# Type 2   (positions)

# Type 4   (eight-line orbital elements)
# Type 5   (close approach tables)
# Type 6   (fake astrometry)
# Type 7   (currently unused)

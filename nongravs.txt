   Find_Orb supports (at present) five different non-gravitational force
models.  More may be added later.

   'Solar radiation pressure (radial, 1/r^2)' is the simplest : the model
assumes that the object is pushed outward from the sun by a force that
is proportional to the amount of sunlight hitting it,  i.e.,  the inverse
square of the distance to the sun (except when in the earth's shadow).

   'Solar radiation pressure (two-parameter)' adds a force in the direction
of the object's motion around the sun,  proportional to the radial force.
This is commonly seen with small asteroids and even more so with space
junk.  It is a simplification of the Yarkovsky effect : if the object has
prograde rotation,  it will absorb some sunlight,  emit it as it rotates,
and be (very gently) accelerated.  If its rotation is retrograde,  the
opposite will occur.  For most asteroids,  setting the constraint A1=0
will make sense;  they will show little radial effect,  but the accumulated
acceleration along-orbit will show up nicely.

   'Solar radiation pressure (three-parameter)' adds a force in the
out-of-plane direction,  normal to the other two forces.  This can result
in a better fit to the data for space junk;  I've yet to see it apply to
a natural one.  Even with space junk,  it does not really match the
actual physics and should be used with caution.

   'Comet model (A1 and A2)' applies the standard Marsden-Sekanina force
model;  see page 3 of

http://www.lpi.usra.edu/books/CometsII/7009.pdf

   'Cometary Orbit Determination and Nongravitational Forces',  D. K. Yeomans,
P. W. Chodas, G. Sitarski, S. Szutowicz, M. Krolikowska, "Comets II";  see
'runge.cpp' in the Find_Orb source for more detail.  Also,  note that water
ice is assumed by default,  but this can be changed by editing 'environ.dat'.

   'Comet model (A1, A2, A3)' is usually only used for comets observed at
many apparitions,  and adds an out-of-plane component to the A1/A2 model
(almost identical to the way the three-parameter SRP model works.)

   Note that the SRP and comet models are virtually identical,  except that
for SRP,  the force is just that of sunlight and is simply expressed
as proportional to 1/r^2.  For comets,  a rather complicated scheme is
required to account for the rate of outgassing as a function of distance
from the sun.

/* Slightly modified Nelder-Mead simplex method,  using parameters from

http://www.webpages.uidaho.edu/~fuchang/res/ANMS.pdf

   Note that this boils down to plain old Nelder-Mead for two-dimensional
(n=2) problems.  The paper argues that their modifications have some
theoretical and empirical evidence for improving the speed of convergence
(and,  in some cases,  make convergence happen at all.)  Set alpha = 1.,
beta = 2., gamma = delta = 0.5 if you want the original N-M parameters.

value than the next-to-highest step.  (If we can accomplish that,  we can
repeat simplex_step() and have it work with that point instead.  Otherwise,
we could get stuck in a loop where we keep playing with the same high point.)
However,  after trying two possible improvements,  we give up and do a "full
contraction" around the lowest point.

Thus,  the returned number of evaluations can be :

   rval = 1 if we reflected the high point through the centroid and
      got an improvement,  and did nothing more.
   rval = 2 if the reflection worked out so well that it was better
      than our lowest point,  so we did an "expansion" step,  resulting
      in a second evaluation of the objective function.
   rval = 2 if it _didn't_ work out so well,  and we tried a one-D
      contraction step,  and then _did_ get an improvement.
   rval = n + 2 if the contraction step didn't get fvals[n] < fvals[n-1],
      so we contracted around the lowest point.

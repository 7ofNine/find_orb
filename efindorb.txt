2000    The lat/lon specified for code (%s) in the header is malformed.\n
2000    See https://www.projectpluto.com/find_orb.htm#obs_codes for\n
2000    information about how to fix this.\n

2001    This shows very little motion and is probably a star.\n

2002    Didn't find observer (%s).  Observations will be excluded and
2002    treated as geocentric.

2003      You can fix this by downloading
2003    the current list of MPC stations at\n
2003    https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/lists/ObsCodes.html\n
2003    and saving it to the folder in which Find_Orb runs.

2004      You can read about how to add
2004    an XXX position for a new/temporary observer at\n
2004    https://www.projectpluto.com/find_orb.htm#xxx_code

2005    Didn't find observational bias data file
2005    To include the FCCT14 bias data,  Find_Orb needs
2005    the file 'bias.dat'.  There is more information
2005    about this at https://www.projectpluto.com/bias.htm
2005    Biases will not be applied until the file is available.

2006    Find_Orb can use the NEOCP ephemeris you've given it.
2006    However,  the ephemerides are geocentric.  You'll
2006    get much better results if you select an observatory
2006    code,  preferably one near the equator.  (781) Quito
2006    is best for this purpose.

2007    The observations span %.1f years,  greater than Find_Orb's
2007    maximum span of %.1f years.  If you really want the whole
2007    set of observations (which may not process correctly),  edit
2007    'environ.dat' and look for the MAX_OBSERVATION_SPAN line.

2008    Not all satellite observations were read correctly.
2008    This shouldn't happen.  Please send your observation
2008    file to pluto@projectpluto.com so it can be fixed.

2009    %u observations were duplicates.  They have been removed.

2010    %u satellite observations had incorrect offset data.  The file
2010    'debug.txt' may have further information.  These observations
2010    have been excluded.


2011    %u observations were incorrectly formatted.  These observations
2011    will be ignored.

2012    %u observations are below the horizon.
2013    %u observations were taken in sunlight.
2014    These observations will be excluded.

2015    %u observations match in date and observatory code,
2015    but not in other regards.  They will be ignored.

2016    %u observations match in date, RA/dec, magnitude, and MPC
2016    code but not in other regards.  They will be ignored.

2017    %u observations are from spacecraft,  but aren't marked
2017    as such and lack the 'second line' offset data.  See\n
2017    https://www.minorplanetcenter.net/iau/info/SatelliteObs.html
2017    \nfor info on how to handle spacecraft-based observations.

2018    The date/time for one or more observations is in the future.
2018    If that's not what you expected,  you should check the data.

2019    The file 'elp82.dat' is missing.  Without this file,
2019    lunar positions will be very inaccurate and orbits will
2019    be somewhat less accurate.  Either get the file,  or (better
2019    solution) set up JPL ephemerides.  See
2019    https://www.projectpluto.com/find_orb.htm#de_eph
2019    for details on how to do this.

2020    The file 'ps_1996.dat' is missing.  Without this file,
2020    planetary positions will be inaccurate and orbits will
2020    be somewhat less accurate.  Either get the file,  or (better
2020    solution) set up JPL ephemerides.  See
2020    https://www.projectpluto.com/find_orb.htm#de_eph
2020    for details on how to do this.

2021    No asteroid ephemeris data is available,  so
2021    asteroid perturbations cannot be included.  You can
2021    fix this by downloading the necessary files.  See
2021    https://www.projectpluto.com/ast_pert.htm for details.

/* The re-entrant version of qsort(),  qsort_r(),  is implemented in
subtly but infuriatingly different ways on different platforms (including
as 'qsort_s' on MS Windows).  You can "sort of" work around these,  as

https://github.com/noporpoise/sort_r

   shows.  But I found it easier to write the following.

https://sourceware.org/ml/libc-alpha/2008-12/msg00007.html

   makes an interesting argument that the Linux qsort_r,  which has the
"context" pointer in the comparison function as the third argument,  is the
"right" way of doing things.  (*BSD and Windows have the context pointer as
the first argument.)  The reason is that it means your non-reentrant
qsort() can basically just call the reentrant qsort_r(), with an ignored
NULL context pointer.  (Which,  you'll see,  I've done below.)

   Note that Shellsort is decently fast,  but not nearly as fast as Quicksort.
If sorting speed matters in your application,  either ignore this or modify
the Shellsort to actually be qsort or something similarly fast... I'm tempted
to do so because Sort Algorithms Are Fun,  but I've got too much else to do.

   A note about the gap sequence:  it used to be gap = gap * 3 + 1,  for
a sequence of 1, 4, 13, 40, 121,... I accepted this commonly-used sequence
uncritically for some years,  until testing found it to be _much_ slower
than gap = gap * 8 / 3 + 1 (i.e.,  a smaller gap exponent).  I did some
more testing to search for gaps that would be pairwise relatively prime,
and ideally relatively prime for nearby but non-adjacent gaps.  Hence
the value of gap0 = 250104703.  (For smaller arrays,  this will swiftly
be brought down to a "reasonable" size.)  The following explicitly lists
the gap sequence and their factorizations.

version.  The last "context" parameter is simply ignored on all
architectures of which the author was aware.

   It seems like an excellent idea.  But it's a weird cast that produces a
warning in GCC 8,  and I'm not actually calling the non-recursive sort
anyway;  it's completely untested.  Hence the above #ifdef to remove both
usused code and the warning. If I someday decide I need a non-recursive

   -- It returns the first matching record.  (The original would return
_a_ matching record,  not necessarily the first.)

   -- If the additional parameter 'found' is non-NULL,  then the return
value indicates the location of the first record matching the key if such
a record exists, and *found is set to true.  If no matching record is
found,  then the return value indicates the slot where the record would
be inserted, and *found is set to false.  This allows one to find
"nearby" records and/or to know there a new key would be inserted.

   If 'found' is NULL,  the return value points to the first matching
record,  or NULL if no match is found.       */

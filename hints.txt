# This contains 'hints' for orbital solutions of certain oddball objects.
# For example,  2006 DE160 had a close encounter with Ceres;  fail to include
# asteroid perturbations,  and you won't get a good orbit.  1998 SD9 shows
# signs of the Yarkovsky effect;  fail to account for that,  and you will
# again see large residuals.
